## Introduction

This package has been created to keep my preamble common to all my documents for most of its part. Some packages have been re-edited inside this one to make them compatible with others or to extend them with new features.

## Installation
1. Get a TeX distribution. TexLive is a pretty good one. To make sure you have all you need, the full version is a safe solution, but you can try any other version of your choice.
``` 
sudo apt-get install texlive-full 
```
2. Get this package
```
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex
cd ~/texmf/tex/latex
git clone git@gitlab.com:lucastorterotot/ltstyle.git --origin lucas
```

## Usage
### Guides
Documentation will be published later.

### Some documents for education
One can find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kn9fxcoymh2nzmq/AAD4f_ximo6Pj4Mse9UPJIgSa?dl=0) some documents, written in french, produced with this LaTeX package and [this python package](https://gitlab.com/lucastorterotot/ltLaTeXpyplot).
