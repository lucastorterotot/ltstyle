## Introduction

This package has been created to keep my preamble common to all my documents for most of its part. Some packages have been re-edited inside this one to make them compatible with others or to extend them with new features.

## You are on the `dev` branch

This branch is used to commit common changes between working branches.
You may switch to [`master`](https://gitlab.com/lucastorterotot/ltstyle/blob/master/README.md) to get relevant informations to install and use this package.
